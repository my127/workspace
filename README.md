# Workspace [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/my127/workspace.svg?branch=0.1.x)](https://travis-ci.org/my127/workspace)

Workspace is a tool to orchestrate and bring consistency to your project environments.

## Documentation

### Getting Started
#### Requirements
 - `PHP-7.2+`
 - `sodium` php extension installed and activated in php.ini if it's not enabled by default
 - `curl` if you wish to use the global traefik proxy
 - `docker 17.04.0+`
 - `docker-compose (compose file version 3.1+)`
#### Installation
Download the `ws` file from the [Latest Release](https://github.com/my127/workspace/releases/latest) make executable and move to a location in your PATH, eg.
```
chmod +x ws && sudo mv ws /usr/local/bin/ws
```

### Building

First install development dependencies by running `composer install`. This will set up [humbug/box] as well. 

To build workspace, you can run the `build.sh` script.

To test the build in multiple PHP versions, there is a docker-compose.yml provided.

To build:
```bash
docker-compose build --pull
```
To fix volume permissions, if you are using Linux, run:
```bash
HOST_OS_FAMILY=linux docker-compose up -d
```
If you are using macOS, run:
```bash
HOST_OS_FAMILY=darwin docker-compose up -d
```

You can now do:
```bash
docker-compose exec -u build builder72 /app/build.sh
docker-compose exec -u build builder73 /app/build.sh
docker-compose exec -u build builder74 /app/build.sh
```
